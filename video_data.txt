Comment 4: hey harry ! you could've used selenium's functions to extract all the information required and save it to the db. I think it would have been a lot faster and good than using bs4. Great video btw
Comment 5: "#HarryBhai" if you read this 😉😉
Comment 6: Isn't zenrows better? Currently I'm working on a web scraping gig in which I have to bypass cloudfare and extract like 5000+ pages from a website which is not possible with python alone anymore and for that I used zenrows and it worked as selenium wasn't working as well
Comment 7: Great project 👍🏻 lots of 🫶🏻brother
Comment 8: anyone please guide me i am using pycharm and is it possible to do the same project in it? without VS code only pycharm and mangodb?
Comment 9: People scared of Ai listen 📢
Ai is not a job replacer it’s just a tool to help developers save time well normal people might use it but it will be difficult for them to know what actually they are doing but for developers it will be a piece of cake and remember if you want to do a job which actually is the reality why we all want to learn web dev so for working in a company you need to be a developer who knows about coding not a chilling person who just use Ai prompts with no knowledge so don’t be sacred and keep pushing your skills 🎉

As I started my journey in coding there was no tutor as like u specially in hindi. I faced many challenges and bug issues because my basic knowledge was not too good , basic concepts were not clear.I have lost my career and changed my patah. But after some time i found your video when you started the first HTML series. Specially thanks brother and love u. Kabhi aap professional mat hona aise hi rahana apke video dekhkar sukoon milata hai... Mujhe lagata hai koi to apna hai jo sikhata hai bina kisi aspect ke... Apki bahut jaroorat hai mere jaise logo ki trah. Thanks brother🎉❤

Comment 7: But bhaiya coding m proper sikhna kya or coding se kse job le
Comment 8: Bina degree k Corporate job milna zaroorat se zyada mushkil ho jaayega to isse acha chup chaap se lele degeee kahin se bhi 

Magar sirf degree hone se bhi job nhi milegi, tajoorba bhi hona chahiye tere pass kuch na kuch aur wo tujhe khud se karna padega 

Degree aur experience dono ka hona zaroori seedhi si baat hai. Ek nhi hai to doosre k sahare Naukri milna boht mushkil ho jaayega
Comment 9: A degree opens a lot of doors.. without it, yeah you can still make it big but the amount of opportunities you will get are going to be very minuscule.

Comment 5: 7:17 हैरी ,address bar पर जो लिख रहे हो ,वो इस लिए की आप ही एप्लिकेशन coder हो तो आपको पता है की क्या ,लिख सकते हो ,या किसको कॉल करना है ।लेकिन url पर जाने वाला सब एडमिन नही होगा या app coder नही होगा ।आपके एग्जांपल ज्यादातर डॉक्यूमेंट्स में दिए हुए होते है जो ज्यादातेर प्रैक्टिकल scenario मे सूट नही होते तो सब उपर से जाता है। जो वर्ड भी लिखते हो इनका भी कोई मतलब नहीं होता ,जो सच में मतलब रखते है ।जैसे my navbar , logout  ,logout को url address के suffix मे लिखने से क्या होगा ,नीचे "logout" लिखा पाओगे ,इसका कोई मतलब नहीं है ।logout meaning full word है एप्लीकेशन में और आप ऐसे ही कुछ भी शब्द का यूज करते हो लेकिन होता कुछ नही ,सिर्फ "logout" लिखा पढ़ सकते है ।जैसे मकान का चित्र बनाओ ,या मकान लिखो ।इससे मकान का कुछ लेना देना नही ऐसे।
